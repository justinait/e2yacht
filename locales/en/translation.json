There were times that you ran the boat all night in order to get it back to Michigan and meet my scheduled trip. I appreciate your dedication and commitment to making things happen.”",

We appreciate E2’s professional level of service and the ability to communicate easily with your team. The full range of services you provide is particularly helpful when boat owners must manage their boats from afar.”",
        "text4": "“Elizabeth, we want to thank you for the years of taking care of and running our yacht. You managed our yacht with professionalism, from having her clean and provisioned as we requested to managing the hard work in our absence. Your attention to detail in the ongoing maintenance a yacht requires was greatly appreciated. Your skills as captain and in handling the yacht in all sorts of seas and weather are impressive.”",
        "text5": "“Sometimes in life we're lucky enough to meet the perfect person to do the perfect job. Eugenie's extensive sailing knowledge and experience is shared with gentleness and grace. She respects and understands both her craft and students. She's honest, humorous, tri-lingual (!), strong in body, mind and spirit and a delight to be with whether sailing or on land. Thanks Eugenie!”",
        "text6": "“Eugenie is knowledgeable, enthusiastic, personable and she is a great teacher. It is rare to find all these qualities in one person! We look forward to more lessons with Eugenie during the 2011-2012 season. Whenever friends ask us for a recommendation for a sailing instructor - from the most basic to advanced levels – we always send them to Eugenie!”",
        "text7": "“Dear Elizabeth and Eugenie, Your combined professionalism and skills truly put a lot of my anxiety to rest and carried us through. Thanks so much. Our sailboat’s namesake, the Eagle, is a good metaphor for camaraderie and for good times: I hope to exploit this to the max in the coming years. You both are welcome to sail her anytime the opportunity permits. Love you both.”"
